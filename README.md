# image-captioning
##### The goal of image captioning is to convert a given input image into a natural language description.
The objective of our project is to learn the concepts of a CNN and LSTM model and build a working model of Image caption generator by implementing CNN with LSTM.​
The task of image captioning can be divided into two modules logically .​

 - Image based model ​
 - Language based model ​
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The most beautiful part of this project is that it uses all concepts of AI i.e.​
 * Deep learning ​
 * Machine Learning ​
 * Natural Language Processing 
 
​at one place which covers all topics in AI and it uses module Tensorflow which is provided by Google.​
​
- The other best thing is its use, that is so helpful to visually impaired people that it can let them to know what they are seeing.​

 ### Real time usage​
 - Aid to the Blind​
​
 - Google Image Search​
​
 - Self Driven cars​
​
 - CCTV Camera Alarm​
